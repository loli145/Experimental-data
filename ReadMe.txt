1. The three '.mat' files correspond to the experimental data for each of the three graphs. For example, 'ExperimentdataA.mat' corresponds to the experimental data for graph A.
2. In each '.mat' file, the first row of the cell contains the interaction matrix, temperature, the number of iterations at each temperature, and the parameter of plot, respectively. 
3. In each '.mat' file, from the third to the last row are the experimental data for 100 runs respectively. For example, in the third row, the first column is the variation of intensity during annealing process. The second column is the evolution of Hamiltonian during annealing process. The third column is the variation of spin state during annealing process. 
4. Run 'PlotGraphA.m' file to plot Fig. 6A and D. Run 'PlotGraphB.m' file to plot Fig. 6B and E. Run 'PlotGraphC.m' file to plot Fig. 6C and F.
